# Fashion-Mnist-trained
 FSU machine learning class. I used this NN on Fashion-Mnist to familiarize students with Keras. 
 The first model 'fashion.h5' is non linear, inspired by insection. See the image fashion.png. 
 Accuracy = .9055 on test data.
 
 The second model 'fashionDR.h5' uses dilations and residual networks. See the image fashionDR.png 
 Accuracy = .9124 on Test data.

Keras version 2.2.0
